"""``app/agent/draft_sender.py`` — the draft-flow half of the "one send
seam" fence (``apps/api/CLAUDE.md``: sends happen ONLY via the draft flow
or the emergency safety path — there is no third call site). This module
is the FIRST outbound-send call site this codebase has ever had (#108's
parallel branch adds the SECOND, the emergency safety path).

What it does
------------
A periodic ticker that claims ``drafts`` rows the approve/edit-and-send
finalize path (``app/agent/nodes/finalize_draft_decision.py``) marked
``'approved'`` with a ``scheduled_send_at`` that has since come due,
drains them through an INJECTABLE :class:`app.integrations.sms_sender.
SmsSender`, and writes every durable side effect of an actual send: the
outbound ``messages`` row, ``drafts.sent_message_id`` + ``status='sent'``,
``cases.status='awaiting_tenant'``, the ``trust_metrics`` clean-vs-edited
increment (plus, #60: the ``consecutive_clean`` streak counter and the
graduation write once a ``'routine'`` streak reaches
``settings.trust_graduation_threshold`` — see "Trust ladder graduation
(#60)" below), and the ``audit_log`` ``'sent'`` row.

Cost metering (#111, schema-v1.md v1.12)
------------------------------------------
The ``'sent'`` audit payload also carries ``segments``/``sms_cost_cents``,
computed by the pure ``app/integrations/sms_segments.py`` helper from the
SAME ``body`` this tick just sent (never from the Twilio response --
Twilio's REST API doesn't return a segment count). ``app/cost_reporting.py``
is the read side: cost-per-case/door/month, each answerable by one query
over ``audit_log``.

Trust ladder graduation (#60)
------------------------------
Every send through this ticker (regardless of whether a landlord approved
it or the trust ladder auto-sent it — this module makes no distinction,
it drains ANY due ``'approved'`` row) upserts the SAME ``trust_metrics``
row this module already maintained: a clean (unedited) send increments
``consecutive_clean``; an edited send resets it to 0. Immediately after
that upsert, for a clean ``'routine'`` send ONLY, a second, atomic UPDATE
(:data:`_GRADUATE_ROUTINE_TRUST_SQL`) checks whether the streak has
reached :attr:`app.config.Settings.trust_graduation_threshold`
(FOUNDER-PROVISIONAL — see that setting's own docstring) and, if so, flips
``autonomy_unlocked = true`` + ``unlocked_at = now()`` (clearing any prior
``revoked_at``) and appends a ``trust_unlocked`` ``audit_log`` row
(``actor='system'``). ``'urgent'``/``'emergency'`` severities accumulate
the SAME counters (an inert streak that can never graduate — the
graduation query's own ``severity = 'routine'`` predicate is a hardcoded
SQL literal, not a bound parameter, per #60's PR #202 senior-review note:
"treat the emergency/urgent rows as inert counters").

Supersession belt-and-braces for auto-sent drafts (#60 safety review
MEDIUM-1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``app/agent/nodes/draft_response.py``'s own stale-then-insert logic is the
PRIMARY fix: it cancels a still-unsent ``auto_send=true`` draft the moment
a newer tenant message triggers a fresh one, under the per-case advisory
lock. This module carries a SECOND, independent layer for the same
invariant, in case that primary path is ever bypassed: :data:`_CLAIM_
DRAFT_SQL` itself refuses to claim (and therefore send) an ``auto_send =
true`` draft if a newer inbound message has landed on its case since it
was drafted (never a landlord-approved draft — that predicate only ever
looks at ``auto_send = true`` rows); :func:`_claim_draft` then cancels
that refused draft (:data:`_CANCEL_SUPERSEDED_AUTO_SEND_DRAFT_SQL`) and
records a ``send_cancelled`` audit row, so it never sits stuck
``'approved'`` re-appearing as a "due" candidate forever.

The undo window is data, not a sleep (schema-v1.md's own phrase) — this
module never sleeps waiting for a specific draft; it only ever asks
"which approved rows are due right now" and claims exactly those.

Resolved-case guard belt-and-braces (#206)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``app/routers/cases.py``'s ``POST /v1/cases/{id}/resolve`` is the PRIMARY
fix for "a draft must never send after its case is resolved": it cancels
every still-``'pending'``/``'approved'`` draft on the case, in the SAME
transaction as the case's own ``UPDATE``, the moment a landlord resolves
directly. This module carries a SECOND, independent layer for the same
invariant, in case that primary path is ever bypassed (the exact same
"belt-and-braces" shape as the supersession guard above): :data:`_CLAIM_
DRAFT_SQL` itself also refuses to claim ANY ``'approved'`` draft whose
case has since become ``status = 'resolved'`` — never a landlord-approved
row exception this time; a resolved case's draft is refused regardless of
``auto_send``. Unlike the supersession guard, a draft refused ONLY for
this reason is not actively cancelled here — it is simply never claimed,
falling through :func:`_claim_draft` as a silent no-op (the row stays
``'approved'`` forever, re-appearing as a due candidate on every future
tick but never winning the claim). This is deliberate: the primary fix
(``cases.py``) already cancels the common case immediately, so this guard
almost never fires in practice; it exists purely to make "never sends
after resolve" true even against a code path (present or future) this
module's authors didn't anticipate — e.g. ``app/agent/case_lifecycle.py``'s
own ``sweep_cases()`` tenant-confirmed leg, which (unlike its auto-stale
leg) is NOT excluded from ``awaiting_approval`` and could in principle
auto-resolve a case with a still-approved draft sitting on it. A stuck-
forever-``'approved'``-but-never-sent row is a strictly SAFER failure mode
than a send after resolve, and is a pre-existing, out-of-scope gap in
``sweep_cases()`` itself (not fixed here — only insured against).

Idempotent claim — single-flight per row (skill doc Phase 3's own
obligation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
:data:`_CLAIM_DRAFT_SQL` is the ONE atomic conditional UPDATE that decides
who gets to process a given draft: ``UPDATE drafts SET status='sending'
WHERE id=:id AND status='approved' AND scheduled_send_at <= now()
RETURNING id`` — matching a candidate SELECT to zero rows (lost the race)
is a silent, correct no-op; two overlapping ticks (or two process
instances) can never both win the SAME row. Crash-safety follows from this
alone: an ``approved`` row with a due ``scheduled_send_at`` survives a
process restart untouched (it is DB state, not in-memory schedule state)
and the next tick claims it exactly once.

Crash/failure semantics — a stuck ``'sending'`` row is the DESIGNED
failure mode, never a silent double-send
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once a row is claimed (flipped to ``'sending'``), a crash or a raised
exception from :class:`SmsSender` before the final write-transaction
commits leaves that row stuck at ``'sending'`` forever (this issue does
not add a retry/timeout sweep for stuck rows — out of scope; flagged for a
future issue). This is DELIBERATE and matches the skill doc's own
"Expected numbers" section verbatim: "a crash between claim and
Twilio-ack is surfaced as a stuck ``sending`` row, never a silent
double-send." A stuck row is visible (queryable, an operational signal);
a duplicate outbound SMS to a tenant is not recoverable at all. Never
retried automatically here — the fenced-off alternative (a query
that resends 'sending' rows past some age) would risk exactly the
double-send this design avoids without a `twilio_sid` idempotency key from
the provider, which this issue does not have.

The edited/empty-``final_body`` guard (safety review, this round)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
An edited draft (``edited=true``) whose ``final_body`` is somehow empty
(structurally shouldn't happen — routers/drafts.py's edit-and-send handler
always sets both together — but this module never assumes that elsewhere)
is refused outright: logged loudly and Sentry-paged, the row left stuck
``'sending'`` (same stuck-row semantics as any other send failure above) —
NEVER silently falling back to ``drafts.body`` (the ORIGINAL text the
landlord explicitly edited away). Sending the original text back after a
landlord deliberately replaced it would be a silent, wrong-content send —
strictly worse than a stuck row.

Session discipline — never hold a DB connection across the network call
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mirrors every other node in this package (e.g. ``draft_response.py``'s own
"never hold a pooled connection across a slow external call"): claim (own
short transaction) -> read recipient/case context (own short transaction)
-> call :meth:`SmsSender.send_sms` OUTSIDE any open session -> write the
final durable state (one more short transaction). A slow/hanging Twilio
call therefore never pins a pooled connection.

Wiring (#108 integration, landed)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
:func:`sender_tick` — one tick, not the standalone infinite loop below —
is called from ``app/scheduler.py``'s existing 60s ticker, alongside the
emergency escalation chain sweep and the degraded-mode retry sweep, using
:func:`app.integrations.sms_sender.get_default_sms_sender`'s real
Twilio-backed adapter. One scheduler owns all periodic work; this module
never starts its own competing lifespan task. :func:`run_sender_loop`
(the standalone, independently-tickable loop with its own interval/
stop-event) remains as a fully-built, independently testable seam — kept
for its own test coverage and as a documented alternative wiring, but is
NOT invoked from ``app/main.py`` or ``app/scheduler.py``; the scheduler
calls :func:`sender_tick` directly instead. Because that call shares the
SAME ticker task as the other three sweeps, :func:`sender_tick` bounds its
own worst-case duration against a wall-clock deadline (see
:data:`DEFAULT_TICK_DEADLINE_SECONDS`) so a large send backlog can never
push the next tick — and thus the next emergency re-escalation sweep —
meaningfully late.
